Ninja Framework
===============

This "framework", was created with the purpose of simplifying the organization of files within a frameworkless messy and small PHP project. It aims to be dead simple and not too serious. Under no circumstance use this for medium to big projects, you are going to have a bad time. You know what, just don't use it! Use [CodeIgniter](https://github.com/EllisLab/CodeIgniter/) or [CakePHP](https://github.com/cakephp/cakephp), or better, [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails), if you are willing to learn (always worth it).

Here we call things to be done "a lo ninja" when these are messy and with bad coding practices. Paradoxically, ninjas are silent and will kill you in the cleanest way possible. But the catchphrase was already here when I came.

It's also a tool for learning. And it's in spanish, I don't know why I'm writing this in english. But here everyone speaks spanish, and because is also a tool for learning I decided to do it in spanish.

Oh! I almost forgot, this project uses [Idiorm](https://github.com/j4mie/idiorm) and [Paris](https://github.com/j4mie/paris) for ORMing, so all the credits for that to them.
